     I wish this profile looked more complete (and you might ask, "complete how?" who knows anymore), but the truth is I
     only started this journey this year.
     I'm not rushing the process, and I might (or might not) have started heavily on learning as much as I could
     as you can see, looking forward to help out and to contribute to this universe and also looking forward to make
     mistakes again and again.
